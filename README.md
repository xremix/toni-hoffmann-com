# Toni-Hoffmann.com

Open Source has always a passion, so why not open sourcing my private portfolio website?!

You can see the results at [toni-hoffmann.com](https://www.toni-hoffmann.com).

## Technologies used

- **Angular** is the root framework of this application
- **Bootstrap** is used for the layout, buttons and navigation
- **ng-xGallerify** is my gallery component that hosts the photography portfolio

Everything else is developed from scratch.

## Setup

- Install Node.js
- Install [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- Clone the Repository
- Run `npm i` in your local repository

## Use

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deploy

- Run `ng build --prod` to build the project
- Upload the artifacts in the `dist/toni-hoffmann-com` directory to the webspace
- Make sure you have rewrite rules set up for your webserver
- Make sure deploy the api, which is part of a private repository
